Linearity\n","- The first assumption of a linear regression just so happens to be the simplest to check for, the linearity assumption. You already know that the “linear” in linear regression comes from the way the data looks when plotted on an X-Y coordinate plane–a line! To detect if this assumption is met, you just have to make sure that the points on the plot appear to fall along a straight line. \n","- If the visualization looks like a random cloud, or resembles a curve rather than a line, then the assumption is considered invalidated, meaning that this model does not fit the data well. You might need a different or a more complicated model for this dataset. In contrast, a scatterplot that shows the data points clustering around a line indicates that linear regression would be an appropriate model to represent the relationship between X and Y.\n","2. Normality\n","- Next up on the checklist is the normality assumption. This assumes that the residual values, or errors, are normally distributed.\n","- Since this assumption is about residuals, you cannot check the assumption until after the model is built. But once the model is built, you can create a specific plot, called a quantile-quantile or QQ plot of the residuals. If the points on the plot appear to form a straight diagonal line, then you can assume normality and check this assumption off the list.\n","3. Independent Observation\n","- Next is the independent observation assumption, which states that each observation in the dataset is independent. Here, it is helpful to use contextual information about data collection and the variables used to determine if this is true.\n","- If the assumption is met, we would expect a scatterplot of the fitted values versus residuals to resemble a random cloud of data points. If there are any patterns, then we might need to re-examine the data.\n","4. Homoscedasticity\n","- Last but not least, the Homoscedasticity Assumption is fourth on the list. This one sounds complicated, but knowing the literal meaning of the term helps. Homoscedasticity means“having the same scatter.”\n","- Scatterplots come to the rescue once again when checking for homoscedasticity. Returning to the scatterplot of fitted values versus residuals, there should be constant variance along the values of the dependent variable. This assumption is true if you notice no clear pattern in the scatterplot. Sometimes you’ll hear this described as a “random cloud” of data points. But, for example, if you observe a cone-shaped pattern, then the assumption is invalid."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4eecc7ff-88f5-49e4-98fc-18f2a0e39197","metadata":{"id":"4eecc7ff-88f5-49e4-98fc-18f2a0e39197"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.4"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
